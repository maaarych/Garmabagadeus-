cover the target_en.py file with unittest to reach 100 percent in coverage modul
---------------------------
GitHub Copilot
To ensure 100% coverage, you need to write tests that cover all functions and all branches within those functions in your target_en.py file.

However, without seeing the full target_en.py file, I can't provide specific tests. But I can give you a general idea of how to approach this:

Test all functions: Make sure you have at least one test for each function in target_en.py.

Test all branches: If a function has conditional logic (like if/else statements), write tests to cover all possible branches.

Test edge cases: Consider edge cases, such as empty inputs, inputs with one element, or inputs with unusual values (like negative numbers for a function that expects positive numbers).

Test error handling: If a function is supposed to handle errors, write tests to ensure that it does so correctly.

After writing your tests, you can use the coverage.py tool to check your test coverage:

Run your tests with coverage by running coverage run -m unittest discover in your terminal.
Generate a coverage report by running coverage report in your terminal.
The coverage report will show you the percentage of your code that is covered by tests. If it's less than 100%, the report will show you which lines are not covered, so you can write additional tests to cover those lines.

how much code is covered with tests
---------------------------------
As an AI, I don't have the ability to directly run coverage tools on your codebase. However, I can guide you on how to do it yourself.

To determine how much of your code is covered by tests, you can use a tool like coverage.py. Here's how you can use it:

Install coverage.py by running pip install coverage in your terminal.
Run your tests with coverage by running coverage run -m unittest discover in your terminal. This will run your tests and collect coverage data.
Generate a coverage report by running coverage report in your terminal. This will print a report to the terminal showing the coverage of each file.
(Optional) Generate a more detailed HTML report by running coverage html. This will create an htmlcov directory with an HTML report that you can view in your web browser.
The coverage report will show you the percentage of your code that is covered by tests.
